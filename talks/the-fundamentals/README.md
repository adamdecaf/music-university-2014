# The Fundamentals: Marketing, Recording, Touring, Distribution

## Human Elements

- Choose your shows and releases wisely
  - Don't play every show
- Let your passion seek through
- Find fans who are at venues you visit for similar shows.

## Studios

- Recording studies are a gateway to making a mark in history
  - Important to be prepared for that
  - Even your mistakes and bad takes are recorded.

## Touring

- Finding a place to stay, food to eat
- Find areas
  - Home away from home
- Set dates, a route, venues
  - Often 5-6 months in advance
    - Weekend shows can be this far out too. (In bigger cities)
  - ~3 months out for lots of weekday shows
- Find local record stores in each city.
  - They often want to buy your CD's

- When venues look at artists
  - Random ordering of artists they haven't worked with
  - Similar artists to some selected (ones that have already played there) 
  - Specific dates they don't have shows
    - That the venue also has free
- Users that have access to book / manage the artist during a time range.
  - Very useful for tours (out of state, eg.)
- Indie On The Move
  - What's their policy on scraping that data?
