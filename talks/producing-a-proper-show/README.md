# Producing a Proper Show

## Making a show

- Booking -> "Confirmed" -> Riders -> Contract
  - Lots of smaller shows are "Handshake deals"

## General

- Newsletter exports
  - Venues played at / Artists hosted
- Local printing place hookups
- Shows have labels
  - "Confirmed" etc.

## Venues

- Need to list staff on hand to help artist setup
- "Try to break even at 1/2 sold"
- Need to support 3rd parties running a show
- Poolstar
  - $400 / (year?)
  - Buy reports of an artist's history
    - Venues, ticket sales, etc..
- Venue specific checklist items
- Venue reported ticket sales

## Artists

- Need to be able to leverage a tour manager
  - Just a user that can manage an artist.
- Legal framework help?
  - Help with deals and riders?
- Self promotion
  - Self reported ticket sales
