# From the Studio to Reality: Pressing Vinyl and CDs and Distributing Your Music

- Don't give up the fact that "looking good" is valuable
  - "Good enough" culture

## Phsyical vs Digital

__Only having one__

- Could be good for a specific band
  - What's your fan base like?

__Having Both__

- Generally easier to sell.
  - Appeals to both sides of fans

### Physical

- Risks of your product not looking as professional as big labels
- Having a spine
  - Never upside down!!
- When sending to someone who can help promote you make sure it's unwrapped.
- When sending to radio stations make sure it has a UPC
  - Signifies that listeners can buy it
- Having a point in space to document is valuable.
  - It's a connection to your work

## Backln Thoughts

- Ability for artists to send physical vs digital
  - Small run of promotional CD's
- Integration with local dealers and brokers
- Let artists show off custom things they do for their bands.
  - Special runs for a specific event (either in past or upcoming)
  - As a historical landmark
