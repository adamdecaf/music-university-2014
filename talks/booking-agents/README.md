# You Canâ€™t Do It Alone: Getting the Support of a Booking Agency

## Steps

- Artists have a few steps to get going
  - Making something that can be produced
  - Curating that first production

## Artists

- Spreadsheets
  - Places we've played, places we want to play
  - Merch sales, expenses
  - Who can we reach out to?
  - How much money can we bring in?
  - How many tickets can you sell?
    - How many albums have you sold?
  - Need to show you can make money for venues, managers, and labels

## Managers

- Can help open doors for an artist
  - Even doors that the artist doesn't know exists.
- Find and promote shows
- Performance / brand advice
- Access / help with making professional media
- Can help your niche grow the best it can
- Typically 10-20% of an artist's gross income
  - Often flexible for smaller bands

## Booking

- Largely of referals

## Backln

- Cross venue users can share and refer artists
  - Cross artist sharing / connecting to refer each other
  - How to capture the human element involved?
- Managers from other artists should be able to contact an artist.
  - As the official manager from that artist
- There should be a "primary" manager assigned to a band
  - And similar titles (contact points) for a venue
- Similar to ability to find web designers being able to find a manager
- Fees similar / based like a retainer
  - $25? __$50__? $100?
    - Monthly?
  - "vs agreements"
    - 15% of gross income vs a fixed fee / month
